        <h1>Happy Anniversary, Bubu ‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>
        <p>
          I was told to ink down beautiful words or peoms, as I began with excitement and zeal to pour my heart in it, all the words in the whole world started lacking, so have made a new word to describe you, "Sainshu", which means to have a person who ain't just a walking green forest but also kind, humble, loyal to fault, understanding, pure, innocent, big bear, the Tibetan plateau of his people, well dressed, hot as fire, and has got a personality of a Bengal tiger, so gorgeous, charismatic, royal and most of all a rare sight of nature's most beautifully created human.<br><br>
          You are everything I craved and lacked. The missing piece of my heart was you, that fitted right in me. Amid all the fights, anger, madness I have found myself to be missing you, craving for your presence and needing you to hug me. You have moved mountains for me, without boasting even for once. Your soft gaze, pressed lips, dilated pupils have always told said 'I love you' for more loudly than your words. Anything I write would never ever be able to be equal to half of the amount of love for you. Broadcasting my thoughts in sky would be appropriate, maybe, I'll somedayüß®. I love you much, bubu üòô.<br><br>
          These 3 years have been wonderful. Every moment and every day, good or bad have made us grow even closer to each other. Didn't know the love I have craved all my life was right infront of me, always by my side, subtly creeping in my life with abundant of love and affection from my Parents, Friends and relatives. So perfectly you are made, has always inspired me, motivated to work and has been a reason for my small successes. Life with you has been peaceful but dramatic like a sunset. So dramatic like it changes the course of time and so peaceful that one chooses it to be their last vision while on death bed. High & lows, had never felt normal until you held my hand, made my heart skip a beat and nurtured my soul. <br><br>
          It is commonly known, at least to me, that new people heal the old pains and take away the scars. You proved me, you didn't heal me like I needed you for healing, you gently set me through the journey of self-healing while you held me whenever I broke down. I know, I can be very difficult at times but with you, even if, I have tried my level best to be, have never once been pointed out by you to be as such. You loved ever ounce, every being of me, scars or not. It takes strength to be with a strong, outspoken and hot headed lady and you have so reflected. Your energy is like the morning sunrays breaking dawn, it's soft, warm, comfortable and more importantly so handsome. <br><br>
          I love you so much, so incredibly much that my heart is full and there's left to shower over the world. You have rocked my world in all known ways to mankind. From the moment we shared a moment to the moment we share a memory, it only gave me pointers on love, care, affection, understanding, compromise, trust and forgiveness. With you I can walk to the end of times and still it won't be enough. In every parallel universe, i know we have found each other, there is no other person ever made who can be mine better than you! <br><br>
        </p>
