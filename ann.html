        <h1>Happy Anniversary, my love! </h1>
        <p>
All my life I've been looking for love and never it once occured to me to look for in close proximity, until my Mom started admiring you, until my friends started teasing me by your name, until I felt jealous finding out that you might like someone else. Wrong of me to tell, I fell for you on 15th May 2022, as it had happened way back maybe around 2019. I don't actually remember someone's something if that weren't something I like or hate, and you definitely were someone I liked. The way uncle had treated me, the way our parents found each other and the way you never even tried to flirt with me even though we were alone and I was vulnerable and very susceptible to flirt. For you the story started from the day we went to the belong but for me it was had started it had started the day I sat in your car. Maybe it was the way uncle treated me gave an idea that a man born from this man would definitely be more and dear lord, am i right! You loved me in ways I never thought love could be. You comforted me like nobody had. I always had a soft spot for you. The man who would patiently wait for his love and never look at another one and a man this Hot and Sexy, made me proud of myself. When a man who is looked up by the world loves and sacrifices for a woman, the worth of the woman becomes sumptuous. Thank you for not only proving me "love you to the moon and back" but also keeping me at a sky-high. I love you sweetheart üíã
